Most Kafka images are not build with an ARM-based Java, so most images/docker-compose/etc. won't work on a Raspberry Pi.

The ISNITO/docker-kafka-arm project in GithHub (https://github.com/ISNIT0/docker-kafka-arm) does work, but had problems
getting networking configured correctly and constantly got OutOfMemory exceptions.  It also started quite slow and appeared fairly
laggy when trying to run some of the kafka utilities like kafka-topics or kafka-console-producer.


Best/easeiest seems to deploy natively on Raspian.
-Zookeeper can be deployed via apt-get: sudo apt-get install zookeeper zookeeper-bin zookeeperd
-Kafka must be manually installed.  I followed https://medium.com/@oliver_hu/set-up-a-kafka-cluster-with-raspberry-pi-2859005a9bed
-To start Kafka up at RPi boot, add to /etc/rc.local.
